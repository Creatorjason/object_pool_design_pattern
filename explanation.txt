Introduction: 
The Object Pool Design Pattern is a creational design pattern in which a pool of objects is initialized and created beforehand and kept in a pool. As and when needed, a client can request an object from the pool, use it, and return it to the pool. The object in the pool is never destroyed.

When to Use:
When the cost to create the object of the class is high and the number of such objects that will be needed at a particular time is not much.
-Letâ€™s take the example of DB connections. Each of the connection object creation is cost is high as there is network calls involved and also at a time not more than a certain connection might be needed. The object pool design pattern is perfectly suitable for such cases.

When the pool object is the immutable object
         -Again take the example of DB connection again. A DB connection is an immutable object. Almost none of its property needs to be changed

For performance reasons. It will boost the application performance significantly since the pool is already created
